# Frontend Security

What the frontend already does, and what hosting and the backend must provide.

## In place (frontend)

| Area                    | Measure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| XSS                     | No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `innerHTML` or `eval` anywhere. All user and API text is rendered through React (auto-escaped). Lint bans `console.log`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Content-Security-Policy | Injected as a `<meta>` tag in production builds (`vite.config.ts` → `contentSecurityPolicy`): `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: blob: <api>; font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' <api>; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'`. The API origin is added automatically when `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is absolute. |
| Third parties           | None at runtime. Fonts are self-hosted (`@fontsource`), with no Google Fonts requests and no IP leakage to third parties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| URLs from the API       | `resolveApiUrl()` passes only http(s), protocol-relative, `blob:` and `data:image/…`. `javascript:` / `data:text/html` become harmless same-origin paths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Tokens                  | Isolated in `services/tokenStorage.ts`. Stored values are shape-validated, and corrupted or tampered entries are discarded. A garbled `expires_in` counts as expired. Tokens are never logged, never put in URLs and never in error messages (only the `Authorization` header). **SAF audit 2026-11-06:** a sign-out/sign-in in another tab now invalidates this tab's cached session (`storage` event). ⚠️ Pending in Moonlight (PORTING_PARITY sync log). |
| Error bodies            | **SAF audit 2026-11-06:** API error bodies are untrusted. `apiClient` keeps only well-formed `{ field: string, issue: string }` details, so a malformed body can't crash a form (non-string React child) or throw inside the error path. ⚠️ Pending in Moonlight. |
| Fonts vs CSP            | Fonts are never inlined as `data:` URIs (`src/config/build.ts`), which `font-src 'self'` would block. |
| Email format            | Strict practical pattern (`identifier.ts`): no markup or quotes, no leading, trailing or double dots, valid hostname labels, alphabetic TLD, local part ≤ 64. ASCII only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Input                   | Client-side validation plus `maxLength` caps (identifier 254, password 128). The server must still validate everything. Client checks are for UX only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Error messages          | Sign-in failures are generic ("details don't match"), never "no account with this email". 5xx bodies and exception text are never shown to the user. Route error details are logged only in development.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Stored designs          | Saved designs (mock `localStorage` now, `/designs` API later) are untrusted: `sanitizePlannerState()` rebuilds every field, maps unknown ids to defaults, clamps numbers to the planner rules, caps frames at 16 and the list at 50, and **never restores photo URLs** (only known bundled samples). Titles render as text.                                                               |
| Uploads & export        | Photos are checked for MIME type, size (≤ 25 MB) and minimum resolution, then used as session `blob:` URLs. The PNG export embeds images via `<img>` and canvas (`img-src`), not `fetch()`, so `connect-src` stays `'self' <api>` with no `blob:`.                                                                                                                                        |
| Secrets                 | None in the repo. `.env*` files are git-ignored except `.env.example`. Only `VITE_*` vars reach the bundle and they're public by design. `API_PROXY_TARGET` (dev only) has no `VITE_` prefix, so it can't leak.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Source maps             | Not emitted in production builds (Vite default).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Dependencies            | `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities (Moonlight 2026-11-05; SAF re-checked 2026-11-06 with the identical lockfile). Versions are pinned to Moonlight's lockfile: an unavoidable upgrade must land in both repos (sync log). |

## Required from hosting (can't be done in the frontend)

Send these as **HTTP response headers** for `index.html` and assets:

```
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'     # clickjacking (not supported in <meta>)
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
Cache-Control: no-cache                              # index.html only
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable   # /assets/* (content-hashed)
```

Also configure an SPA fallback, so unknown paths serve `index.html` with status 200 and the app shows its own 404.

When Google sign-in lands (Phase 5), add `https://accounts.google.com` to `script-src`,
`frame-src` and `connect-src` in the CSP plugin.

## Required from backend

Tracked in [API_ALIGNMENT.md](API_ALIGNMENT.md):

- **Q3:** move the refresh token to an httpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookie. Tokens in localStorage can be read by any XSS.
- **Q2:** refresh and logout endpoints (logout must revoke the refresh token server-side).
- **Q17:** rate-limit `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` and return `429`. Return the same `401` for "unknown account" and "wrong password".
- **Q18:** enforce the same input limits server-side (email ≤ 254, password ≤ 128), and never put stack traces or internals in `error.message`.
